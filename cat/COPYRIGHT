  Dear Erik,
  in August we had a short discussion about the copyright of the Tycho-2
  catalogue, but didn't come to an conclusion.
  A good example for the copyright clause here would be the one that is
  used in the Berkeley Software Distribution:
 .
  -----------------------------8<----------------------------------------
  [See above -- olebole]
  -----------------------------8<----------------------------------------
 .
  The modification is important, since it includes f.e. conversion to
  other formats, combination with other catalogues, corrections and so on.
  Or should I discuss this with someone else? Whom would you recommend?
 .
  Best regards
  Ole Streicher

 the license of the binaries is the same as for the source (according to
 Dustin Lang, author of astrometry.net).
